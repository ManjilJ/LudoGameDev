## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run the project with `npm start`.

## Usage

1. **Moving Pieces**: Once the game board is rendered in the browser, click on any piece to move it according to the game rules.

2. **Random Piece Movement**: To move a random piece of a specific color, click on the corresponding button for that color.

3. **Handling Overlaps**: If pieces overlap, hover over the pieces and click to select and move them during your turn.

4. **Strategy**: This tutorial aims to depict that one of the strategies to develop a game is this codebase also and therefore usable for simple Ludo gameplay. The provided limitations are also left as an exercise for enthusiasts to explore further strategies and enhancements.

5. **Limitations and Future Development**:
   - The following features are not implemented in this version:
     - Random turning of dice to a six in initial gameplay and then converting to one.
     - Controlled turns where only one side's turn is permitted at a time.
     - Safe spots where occupied spots by a different colored piece are not taken.
     - Multiple throws after rolling a six.
     - Websockets for multiplayer game functionality.
     - Advanced features.
   - This project serves as one of the proposed development guidelines and may not include all features expected in a complete Ludo game. It primarily focuses on demonstrating code utility and logic rather than complete gameplay, aiming to provide a foundational understanding while remaining open for enthusiasts to explore and enhance further. Consider that there are refactoring opportunities that can be undertaken to improve the codebase.
   
Note that this partial game itself may be 'playable' in some sense and can be used for experimentation and learning purposes.

**Code Misuse**:
- Please refrain from using any part or whole of the code in ways that violate ethical standards or infringe on intellectual property rights. Respect the author's work and ensure proper attribution and permission where applicable.   

**Continuous Autoplay**:
- If the Continuous Autoplay option is checked, the game play proceeds automatically in a fashion of randomly selecting pieces to move.

**Indexing Conventions**:
- This project uses both 0-based and 1-based indexes. Where 1-based indexes are used, 0 is used as a placeholder and does not affect functionality.

Enjoy!
